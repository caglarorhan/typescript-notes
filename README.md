**My Messy TypeScript Learning Notes**

  here will be first notes which i wrote by handwriting before. Iwill add them sooner.
  
  **Modules**
  2 import types available
  - relative path, like: ``./path1/path2/filename``
  - absolute path, like: ``@path1/path2/filename`` // this points at node_modules folder by default
